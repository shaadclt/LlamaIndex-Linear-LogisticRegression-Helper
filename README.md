This Streamlit application utilizes the LlamaIndex framework for document indexing and querying linear and logistic regression-related information. It uses the OpenAI GPT-3.5 Turbo model for generating embeddings and incorporates various components for efficient document retrieval. Users can input their queries and receive responses based on the indexed documents.
