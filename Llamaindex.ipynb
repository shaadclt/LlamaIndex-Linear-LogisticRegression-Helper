            "Linear regression can be used for time series analysis, but its performance may not be particularly remarkable. This is because time series data often have seasonal or periodic trends, which can be treated as outliers in linear regression and not appropriately accounted for. Additionally, linear regression may not be well-suited for future prediction, which is a common use case in time series analysis. Other algorithms such as ARIMA, ARCH, and LSTM are widely used and generally perform better for time series analysis.\n"
